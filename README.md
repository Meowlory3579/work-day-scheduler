# Work Day Scheduler

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a Work Day Scheduler.

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule  
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner  
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.  
* WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm.  
* WHEN I view the time blocks for that day, THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.    
* WHEN I click into a time block, THEN I can enter an event.  
* WHEN I click the save button for that time block, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage.  
* WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist.  

## The following video demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality
